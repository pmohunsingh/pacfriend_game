# pacfriend_game

Pacfriend is a Pacman-inspired game where the player controls a character to collect all the
pellets while avoiding the enemies in a maze! The game is implemented using Python and
Pygame libraries, and it has several special features that differentiate it from other Pacman
games.

Design and Implementation
The game's design consists of a maze with walls, pellets, power-ups, enemies, and a player
character. The player character moves in four directions and can eat pellets and power-ups,
which grant it temporary invincibility and the ability to eat enemies. The enemies move randomly
in the maze and can kill the player character if they touch it. The game has multiple levels with
increasing difficulty, and the player must complete all the levels to win the game.
The implementation of the game involves using Pygame libraries to create the game window,
load game assets, and manage the game events. Pacfriend’s logic is implemented using
Python, including the game's main loop, collision detection, and enemy AI. The game uses
object-oriented programming (OOP) to create classes for the player character, enemies, and
pellets, which simplifies the code and makes it more modular. Pacfriend also uses state design
patterns to manage different game states, such as the game over screen and the victory screen.
During the implementation, I encountered some difficulties in piecing all the functions together
and making them work in conjunction! I had to snip, edit, and move around the code functions.
The game's graphics are designed using Pygame's built-in drawing functions, this was shown
using the draw function.

Conclusions
I learned a lot from creating Pacfriend, including game design, object-oriented programming,
and Pygame library usage. Pacfriend’s best features include its colors and objects (walls,
snacks, characters). Although the code ran in the beginning, as I started to add more changes
such as the enemy and snacks, my code wasn’t running.
